This code was used to anaylze the data. 
The file switch_swm_enhanced_120214.R is very specific for the analysis in the paper. I added this code here more as a backup for myself.
The switch_swm_general.R might be usefull for other people. You have to create a textfile for every subject first.
This should be done using the craddock 200 parcellation, which can be found here http://ccraddock.github.io/cluster_roi/atlases.html
Using the parcellaiton you have to create a textfile per subject containing a 200 x timepoints matrix.
From this code can provide you both the regional as well the averaged sujbect switching.
